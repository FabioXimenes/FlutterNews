## About this project

Follow the latest news, see news in your favorite category, do a more specific search or even save news to read when you have time! The app was built using [Mobx](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx.dart) for state management and [Flutter Modular](https://github.com/Flutterando/modular) for dependency injection. Data from the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/).

## Observations

- Ios is not working because I do not have a mac to make the firebase integration. I plan to add this feature when I have the opportunity!
- The app shows the title and a brief description of each article, and redirects to the url of the news to see the full article.
